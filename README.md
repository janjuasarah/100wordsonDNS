Email: short for electronic mail, serves as a communication system in which you can send information from one computer to another or multiple other computers. Websites such as gmail, msn, yahoo, and most any other email producing site can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Email is not only limited to text transmission, but media as well (so long as it fits within a certain kb).
DNS: stands for Domain Name System. DNS is a system which controls which server your domain's webpage and email run through. 
It is made up of 5 different components: Nameserver, zone file, a record, cname, and MC records. Each have a specific task which works to direct all functions in the website the visitor uses to a specific response and report.
